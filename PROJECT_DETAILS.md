### Technology Stack Decisions

#### Frontend: React + TypeScript
- **Why React?** Chosen for its component-based architecture, large ecosystem, and excellent developer experience
- **Why TypeScript?** Provides type safety, better IDE support, and reduces runtime errors
- **Styling:** Pure CSS with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, CSS Variables) for simplicity and performance

#### Backend: Node.js + Express
- **Why Node.js?** JavaScript runtime allows code sharing between frontend and backend
- **Why Express?** Minimal, flexible web framework with excellent middleware ecosystem
- **Security:** Implemented Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting, and input validation

#### AI Service: Groq
- **Why Groq?** Fast inference speeds, competitive pricing, and excellent API documentation
- **Model:** Using `llama3-8b-8192` for balanced performance and cost
- **Prompt Engineering:** Structured prompts for consistent, high-quality summaries

#### Email Service: Nodemailer + Gmail
- **Why Nodemailer?** Most popular Node.js email library with excellent Gmail support
- **Why Gmail?** Widely accessible, reliable, and supports App Passwords for security

## 🔧 Development Process

### Phase 1: Backend Development
1. **API Design:** Planned RESTful endpoints for summarization and email sharing
2. **Security Implementation:** Added middleware for CORS, rate limiting, and input validation
3. **AI Integration:** Integrated Groq API with proper error handling and prompt engineering
4. **Email Functionality:** Implemented Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP for reliable email delivery

### Phase 2: Frontend Development
1. **Component Architecture:** Designed modular React components with clear separation of concerns
2. **State Management:** Used React hooks for local state management (no external state library needed)
3. **User Experience:** Implemented loading states, error handling, and responsive design
4. **Form Handling:** Created intuitive forms with validation and real-time feedback

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
1. **API Integration:** Connected frontend to backend with proper error handling
2. **CORS Configuration:** Set up cross-origin requests for development and production
3. **Environment Configuration:** Implemented environment variables for different deployment stages
4. **Testing:** Created test scripts and manual testing procedures

## 🎨 User Interface Design

### Design Principles
- **Simplicity:** Clean, uncluttered interface focusing on functionality
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first design that works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility:** Proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
- **Feedback:** Clear loading states, success messages, and error handling

### Key UI Components
1. **Text Input Area:** Large, resizable textarea for meeting notes
2. **Custom Instructions:** Optional input for specific summarization requirements
3. **Summary Display:** Editable textarea showing AI-generated summary
4. **Email Sharing:** Multi-recipient input with tag-based interface
5. **Status Indicators:** Loading spinners, success/error alerts, and progress feedback

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Backend Security
- **Helmet.js:** Security headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities
- **CORS Protection:** Configured for specific origins in production
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- **Input Validation:** Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **Environment Variables:** Secure storage of API keys and credentials

### Frontend Security
- **Input Sanitization:** Client-side validation for email addresses and text inputs
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Production deployment uses HTTPS only
- **No Sensitive Data:** API keys and credentials never exposed to frontend

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations
- **Request Limiting:** Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error responses with meaningful messages
- **Logging:** Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup and resource management

### Frontend Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading:** Components load only when needed
- **Debounced Input:** Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Responsive Images:** Optimized for different screen sizes
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only essential packages included

## 📊 API Design

### RESTful Endpoints

#### GET /api/health
- **Purpose:** Health check and status monitoring
- **Response:** Server status, timestamp, and environment info
- **Use Case:** Deployment verification and monitoring

#### POST /api/summarize
- **Purpose:** Generate AI-powered summaries
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Meeting notes content...",
    "customPrompt": "Optional custom instructions"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "Generated summary text",
    "originalText": "Original input text",
    "customPrompt": "Used prompt"
  }
  ```

#### POST /api/share
- **Purpose:** Share summaries via email
- **Request Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "summary": "Summary to share",
    "recipients": ["email1@example.com", "email2@example.com"],
    "subject": "Email subject"
  }
  ```
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Success message",
    "recipients": ["sent emails"]
  }
  ```

## 🔄 State Management

### Frontend State
- **Local State:** React useState hooks for component-level state
- **Form State:** Controlled components for all form inputs
- **Loading States:** Separate loading indicators for different operations
- **Error Handling:** Centralized error state with user-friendly messages

### Data Flow
1. User inputs text and custom instructions
2. Frontend validates input and sends to backend
3. Backend processes with Groq API and returns summary
4. Frontend displays summary and enables editing
5. User can edit summary and add email recipients
6. Frontend sends sharing request to backend
7. Backend sends emails and returns success status
